# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project to store the knowledge I learned from the bootcamp's prework course, so that other students of the bootcamp could use them in their studies.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website contains notes from the tools and programming languages we learned during the prework course of the bootcamp (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript). And if you inspect the webpage with your Google Chrome's DevTools console you can see some JavaScript script running in the backround.
